Simple website template using HTML and CSS from Udacity's Introduction to HTML and CSS course.

Download all four files to a folder and double click the html file to vizualize it in your browser.

I just started learning web development so please bear with me xD

Feel free to use this to your project if you want to.

Thank you.
